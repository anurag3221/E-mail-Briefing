# **E-mail-Briefing** #

**1. Use a direct subject line**

In many cases, people decide to open an email based purely on the subject line.

Strong subject lines are brief, descriptive, and whenever possible, action-oriented. For example, "Board Meeting moved to Tuesday, 11/21" is a stronger subject line than "meeting date changed."

The importance of having a strong subject line cannot be stressed enough, especially if the email is being used for direct marketing purposes. Always choose a subject line that will let the receiver know you're addressing their business issues or other concerns.

**2. Use a professional email address**

Having your emails deleted is the last thing you want. One of the best ways to ensure that doesn't happen is to avoid using a non-branded or nondescript address.

If you are representing a company, you should always use the email address your company has provided for you. This instantly makes you look more credible and improves email deliverability substantially. Therefore, be prudent about choosing your professional email address.

However, if you are using a private email address (whether you are a freelancer, or just prefer to use it) you should be careful when selecting your handle.

If you are engaged in B2B marketing, your business email address should always convey your name so the recipient knows where it came from and who they should reply to.

**3. The “reply-all” button should be used sparingly**

Nobody likes to open or read emails that have nothing to do with them, their department, or their responsibilities.

Ignoring unrelated emails can be hard, and the repetitive alerts can be irritating if we're trying to focus on other tasks.

Avoid hitting "reply all" unless you know everyone included on the list needs to receive the reply. Also, make wise use of CC and BCC in email to avoid conversational clutter.

**4. Add a professional email signature**

Professional email signatures can lead to higher ROI rates if you're engaged in marketing campaigns. It makes sense to give your reader additional information about you or your company. Usually, an email signature includes your full name, title, company name, and contact information.

You can add a little publicity too, but don't go overboard with artwork, links, slogans or quotes. Keep your font, type size, and text colour the same as the rest of your email to set a professional tone.
